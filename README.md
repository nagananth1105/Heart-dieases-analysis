Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle. It contains various attributes which are crucial in determining heart disease risk.

Dataset Link

Heart Disease Dataset - Kaggle

Dataset Columns

The dataset consists of the following features:

age: Age of the patient

sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)

cp: Chest pain type (4 values)

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy

thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)

target: Presence of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical analysis.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for prediction.

Model Training & Evaluation: Applying simple machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict heart disease.

Result Analysis: Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results

The project provides insights into the factors contributing to heart disease and achieves a predictive model with high accuracy. Visualizations and model performance metrics help in understanding the effectiveness of the approach.

Future Scope

Implement deep learning models for better accuracy.

Deploy the model as a web application.

Improve feature engineering techniques.
